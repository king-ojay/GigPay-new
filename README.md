# GigPay üöÄ

**A Local Marketplace for Sustainable Job Creation**

GigPay is a web application that connects unskilled gig workers to clients in Rwanda, focusing on reducing youth unemployment through technology-enabled job matching for informal and short-term work opportunities.

## üéØ Mission

To contribute to economic inclusion and development by providing access to short-term work opportunities through technology, particularly addressing the rising unemployment rates among youth in Africa.

## üåç Problem Statement

**WHO:** Youth and informal/unskilled workers in Rwanda  
**WHAT:** Struggle to find consistent income-generating opportunities due to lack of job-matching platforms for small gigs  
**WHERE:** Rwanda, starting with Kigali and expanding to surrounding provinces  
**WHY:** Traditional job boards focus mainly on formal employment, leaving informal gig seekers and employers without a platform for "gig hunting"
